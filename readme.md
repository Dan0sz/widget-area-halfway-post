# Add Widget Area (Sidebar) halfway Post Content for WordPress

This plugin widgetizes the center of your posts to insert e.g. a newsletter subscription box or ads.

## How does it work?

The plugin hooks into the content (`the_content()`) and counts the amount of headers (`<h2>`) and inserts a widget area right before the middle header.
